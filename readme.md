# My keymap for Sofle Keyboard

Original Features:

- Symmetric modifiers (CMD/Super, Alt/Opt, Ctrl, Shift)
- Various modes, can be switched (using Adjust layer and the selected one is stored in EEPROM.
- Modes for Qwerty
- Modes for Mac vs Linux/Win support -> different order of modifiers and different action shortcuts on the "UPPER" layer (the red one in the image). Designed to simplify transtions when switching between operating systems often.
- The OLED on master half shows selected mode and caps lock state and is rotated.
- Left encoder controls volume up/down/mute. Right encoder PGUP/PGDOWN.
